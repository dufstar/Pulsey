Components
- PulsyTour
- PulsyDot
- PulsyTooltip

Process
- user adds pulsy-tour id div to body of target page
- user adds pt-anchor tags to all target elements

COMPLETED
- put dot in center of pt-anchor
- add in click events
- listen for window resize
- add states to local storage
- check to see if pt-anchor has position fixed, and assign that to pulsydot accordingly
- check to see if pt-anchor has position fixed on scroll
- fix weird positioning issue

NEXT
- easy way to customize tooltip note
- way to add custom html within tooltip (links, divs with css, etc.)
- fire event whenever a pulsydot is completed for use by user
- way for user to modify location of dot (special variable in positioning of the dots?) or choose to override position altogether
- choose tooltip pop direction
- choose whether to have a pointer arrow
- begin the css craziness...in a controlled way
- restart pulsydots automatically upon hitting the reset button along with clearing localstorage
- option to show an opt-out button in the tooltip, which sets localstorage to true for all
- option for a 'next' button in all tooltips, which automatically moves you to the next tooltip pulsy.  users can change order as desired
- option to show underlay when pulsy is active
- automatically toggle a tooltip style that prevents the dot from being offscreen
- ask pulsy to give you an inventory of the elements with the pt-tag and which pulsynumber they have so you can easily customize them
- ask pulsy to return you all pulsyarray items and their non-default settings, including the default setup

LATER
- convert to ES6
- convert css to scss
- move js styles into separate js file and import into main one?
- determine whether pulsy dot is near an edge - default tooltip to left or bottom accordingly
- make pulsydots track either local or session storage as an option
